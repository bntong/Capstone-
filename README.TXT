PROJECT TITLE: 
Music Sheet Database Capstone

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: 
This capstone allows a user to input information from a piece of music such as the 
title, the key, the tempo, etc, and is able to store it in a master array list. 
The user can  then specifiy whether he/she wants to view it, search for a title
by keyword, delete a specific index, or edit a specific music sheet by specifying the index they want
to edit. 

EXPLANATION OF VARIOUS CONCEPTS
This capstone was truly challenging for me, since it utilizes most of the concepts we have learned
throughout the year, and then some. It is heavly dependent on the use of ArrayLists, and is how
most information is stored. In addition, I had to learn about the best way to transfer information
through different windows without the information being altered or changed. As I have stated before,
this capstone also uses many new concepts that not covered in the APCS curriculum. For example, I had
to research how to implement and use the JComboBox class, which is basically a drop-down menu. I also
used the JTable class which displays all the information that the user has inputted. All in all, this
capstone was the best project of the year, even though I did not have as much time as others, because
it allowed me to think of a project by myself and stick with it until the end.
